## 1. Introduction to IoT
- **IoT (Internet of Things)** refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.

## 2. Historical Context: Before IoT
- **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)**:
  - Consisted of wireless sensor nodes, also known as motes.
  - Developed over a decade with extensive research focused on low-end nodes.
  - Typical architecture included low-end nodes connected to a gateway, used for specialized applications and cloud-based processing.

## 3. Key Developments in WSNs
- **Idle Listening**:
  - The challenge of energy consumption during idle listening (radio on but not receiving useful packets).
  - Solutions involve maximizing sleep time for radios and activating only when necessary.
- **Low-Power Routing**:
  - RF connectivity issues lead to the necessity of robust routing mechanisms.
  - Importance of link monitoring, retransmissions, and rerouting.
- **Connectivity Discovery**:
  - The problem of broadcast storms in dense networks.
  - Strategies to manage and mitigate broadcast-related issues.

## 4. Evolution to IoT
- **Smartphones**:
  - Revolutionized the role of sensor nodes and gateways.
- **IoT Revolution**:
  - Enabled anything to connect to the internet using standard TCP/IP connectivity.
- **Origin of IoT**:
  - Term coined by British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton around 1999.
  - IoT allows computers to sense and interact with the world autonomously.

## 5. Components of IoT
- **Physical Object (Thing)**:
  - The core entity in IoT.
- **Sensors**:
  - Measure various parameters and provide data.
- **Processor**:
  - Processes data collected by sensors.
- **Actuators**:
  - Execute actions based on processed data.
- **Communication**:
  - Typically radio-based; may or may not be TCP/IP interoperable and often involves cloud offloading.

## 6. Special Characteristics of IoT Devices
- **Primary Function**:
  - Often not computing; designed for specific tasks.
- **Resource Constraints**:
  - Limited in terms of power, computing, and storage.
- **Heterogeneity**:
  - Wide variety of devices and functions.
- **Domain-Specific**:
  - Tailored to specific applications unlike general-purpose computers.

## 7. IoT Trends and Growth
- **Decreasing Hardware Costs**:
  - Makes IoT more accessible.
- **Smaller Form Factor and Weight**:
  - Enhances portability and integration.
- **Increasing Computing Power**:
  - Enables more complex processing.
- **Ubiquitous Internet Access**:
  - Facilitates widespread IoT deployment.

## 8. Related Fields and Applications
- **Closely Related Areas**:
  - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs): Predecessors to IoT.
  - Embedded Systems: Devices that may or may not be internet-connected.
  - Cyber-Physical Systems: Emphasize the interaction between computational and physical processes.
  - Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing: Focus on processing information everywhere.
  - Machine-to-Machine Communication: Emphasizes autonomous interactions between machines.

## 9. Key Application Areas
- **Smart Cities**: Enhancing urban infrastructure and services.
- **Smart Home**: Improving domestic convenience and efficiency.
- **Smart Health**: Advancing healthcare through connected devices.
- **Smart Factories (Industry 4.0)**: Revolutionizing manufacturing processes.
- **Smart Transportation**: Improving transportation infrastructure and vehicle connectivity.
